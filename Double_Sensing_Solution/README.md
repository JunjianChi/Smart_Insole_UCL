# Insole Project 2025

This repository contains the complete design, simulation, and code files for a smart insole system, developed as part of the UCL Bioelectronic Undergraduate program.

## üìÅ Folder Structure

- **3D_Model/**  
  Contains the 3D models of the insole design (e.g., STL or CAD files).

- **ESP_MCU_Code/**  
  Microcontroller code for the ESP series, developed using **ESP-IDF v5.3.0**.

- **ISCAS_PAPER/**  
  Paper drafts, figures, and final versions submitted to ISCAS 2025.

- **mdfile/**  
  Markdown or documentation-related files.

- **Multisim_Simulation/**  
  Circuit simulation files using NI Multisim.

- **PCB/**  
  PCB design files (Gerber, layout, and schematics).

- **WiFi_Server_Code/**  
  Code for the WiFi server used to collect or visualize sensor data from the insole.

## üß† Features

- Real-time pressure or motion sensing via embedded MCU.
- Wireless data transmission using WiFi (ESP).
- Modular system with hardware simulations and 3D enclosure.
- Cross-platform design (MCU ‚Üî Server ‚Üî Client).

## üõ†Ô∏è Development Environment

- **ESP-IDF v5.3.0** (for ESP32/ESP8266 development)
- VS Code IDE (optional for prototype testing)
- NI Multisim (for analog/digital circuit simulations)
- Fusion360 / SolidWorks (for mechanical models)
- KiCad / Altium Designer (for PCB design)
